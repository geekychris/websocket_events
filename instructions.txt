Create me a javascript library that can be part of a react demo app that talks to a backend over websockets.  The purpose of the library is to receive "events" that can then be past onto any handlers that register with the library.  These could be handlers that registered to listen to an update to a specific type of event, where the event may contain updated state information.  Write a service in spring that supports websockets.  It should support a large number of connections using asynchronous IO techniques.  When the client connects it should share a session id.  The service should use this session id so other services can forward requests to the websockets backend that in turn can route to the UI.  Include tests and documentation on the design and how to run.
